Remoturino
==========

Android application for controll over ardunio armed with IR codes!

This project was developed by students at Bergen University Collage attending communications engineering. The goal
of the project was to make an android application to emulate any IR remote controll through the use of an arduino
microcontroller and a bluetooth module.

The arduino device takes commands from the android application via bluetooth and transmitts IR signals to the 
device being controlled.

The motive behind making the application was based on drawbacks with other IR emulating software which require
an internal IR LED and a point-and-shoot operation not sutable for touch screens. With the Remoturino you are
comforably able to controll whatever device you want without aming your smartphone at the television.
